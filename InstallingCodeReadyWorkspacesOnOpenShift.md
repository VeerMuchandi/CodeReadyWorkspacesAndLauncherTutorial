## Installing CodeReady Workspaces on OpenShift



Complete installation instructions are here. 

[https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_codeready_workspaces_for_openshift/1.0.0/html/administration_guide/installing_codeready-workspaces](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_codeready_workspaces_for_openshift/1.0.0/html/administration_guide/installing_codeready-workspaces)

This lab provides quick step-by-step instructions for convenience. Also note that installer will change with 1.1 release.

### Prerequisites

* An OpenShift cluster to install CodeReady Workspaces. A user account to log onto te cluster. If installing with oauth enabled to use openshift authentication, you will need an account with admin privileges.
* Persistent storage on the OpenShift Cluster
* A workstation with `oc` CLI from where you want to run the installer. 

**Note :** Currently there are issues with  `enable-oauth` to allow OpenShift deal with authentication. So in this lab, we will create separate users in Keycloak and let KeyCloak deal authentiation, instead of integrating with OpenShift.


### Download Installer

Create a folder for codeready installation on your workstation from where you can log in to an OpenShift cluster

```
$ mkdir codeready
$ cd codeready
```
Download [codeready-workspaces-installer](https://developers.redhat.com/download-manager/file/codeready-workspaces-1.0.0.GA-operator-installer.tar.gz) using browser into this folder

Untar the installer files.

```

$ tar -xvf codeready-workspaces-1.0.0.GA-operator-installer.tar 
codeready-workspaces-operator-installer/
codeready-workspaces-operator-installer/README.adoc
codeready-workspaces-operator-installer/deploy.sh
codeready-workspaces-operator-installer/config.yaml

$ cd codeready-workspaces-operator-installer
```

### Install CodeReady Workspaces

Create a new project if you want name a project where CodeReady Workspaces will be installed. If not, a project named `codeready` will be created.

```
$ oc new-project wrkspc
```

CodeReady workspaces in the current setup will share a common Persistent Volume across all the workspaces. Each workspace will have its own folder on this persistent storage. Look at the documentation for other kinds of configurations such as a unique PVC for each workspace or a PVC per project.

To provide enough storage for multiple workspaces, I am setting the size of this PVC to 5Gi (change it to whatever size you wish). The default is 1Gi.

These parameters are passed via `config.yaml` file that you get along with the deploy script. 

```
$ sed -i.bak -e "s/CHE_INFRA_KUBERNETES_PVC_QUANTITY: \"\"/CHE_INFRA_KUBERNETES_PVC_QUANTITY: \"5Gi\"/" config.yaml 
```
Run the installer with the command `$ ./deploy.sh --deploy --project=wrkspc` and observe the output. The installer spins up an operator that does the installation of CodeReady Workspace Master, Keycloak server and the backend Postgresql database.

```
$ ./deploy.sh --deploy --project=wrkspc

Observe the pods that come up.

```
$ oc get po -n wrkspc
NAME                       READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
che-operator               0/1       Completed   0          4m

postgres-97bdc58c4-zm85h   1/1       Running     0          4m
```

Also observe the PVC created for Postgresql

```
$ oc get pvc -n wrkspc
NAME            STATUS    VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS        AGE

```

And the routes in the project

```
$ oc get route -n wrkspc
NAME        HOST/PORT                                PATH      SERVICES   PORT      TERMINATION   WILDCARD
codeready   codeready-wrkspc.apps.311.ocpcloud.com             che-host   <all>                   None
keycloak    keycloak-wrkspc.apps.311.ocpcloud.com              keycloak   <all>                   None
```


### Self Register and Log in

Access the codeready route anc click on the `New User Register` link to self register.
![](./images/1.InstallCodeReady.png)

Fill in the details on the next screen and click on `Register` button. 

![](./images/2.InstallCodeReady.png)

Now you will land on CodeReady Workspaces Dashboard where you can create new workspaces as shown below:

### Keycloak User Administration

Let us now access Keycloak route and it takes you to a screen where you choose Administration Console.

![](./images/5.InstallCodeReady.png)

Next you can log into the admin console using your administrator password. If you did not change this password in the `config.yaml` file, then it would be `admin\admin` by default. I suggest changing the password as soon as you login.

![](./images/6.InstallCodeReady.png)

You will now see the KeyCloak dashboard.

Click on the `Users` menu on the left and `View all users` to see the list of users. You should see the self registered user there. Explore all the options you have to manage the users here.
